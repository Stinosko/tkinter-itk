# Tkinter-ITK
The purpose of this project is to make an interactive ITK viewer with Tkinter in python.

It is very early in development and probably most things will not work.

I'm not a professional programmer, if you have questions or suggestions please create a issue or make a pull request with your suggested imporvements. I try to answer them when i have time. 

To understand certain Tinkter behaviours i use, i kept some example scripts I found online in the Misc folder, certain advanced features are based on those.

I made an `example.ipynb` script how you can use it in a jupyter notebook.  
Use `run_itk_tkinter.py` to run a standalone version

It can be installed by `pip install tkinter-itk`.
