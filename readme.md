# Tkinter-ITK
This is a project attempting to make an interactive ITK viewer with Tkinter in python.

It is very early in development and probably will not work. Feel free to look through the code for inspirations for your own projects.

I'm not a professional programmer, i know there is lack of comments in the code and lots of violations of programming conventions. If you have questions or suggestions please create a issue or make a pull request with your suggested imporvements.  

To understand certain Tinkter behaviours i use, i kept some example scripts I found online in the Misc folder, certain advanced features are based on those.

I made an example.ipynb script how you can use it in a jupyter notebook.
