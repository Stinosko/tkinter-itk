# Tkinter-ITK
This is a project attempting to make a ITK viewer with Tkinter in python.
This project helps me keeping track of what I changed during development, feel free to look through the code for inspirations for your own projects. I don't know if i ever will finish it in a usefull state. 

To understand certain Tinkter behaviours i kept some inspirational example scripts I found online in the Misc folder.

I'm not a professional programmer, i know there is lack of comments in the code and lots of violations of conventions. If you have questions or suggestions please create a issue or make a pull request with your suggested imporvements.
